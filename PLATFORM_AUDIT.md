# SSELFIE STUDIO - PLATFORM AUDIT & SIMPLIFICATION PLAN

## CURRENT STATE ANALYSIS (What's Actually Working)

### ✅ WORKING COMPONENTS
1. **Authentication System** - Replit Auth working properly
2. **Database Schema** - PostgreSQL with proper tables
3. **Basic Navigation** - Routes between pages
4. **Payment System** - Stripe integration working (€47/€97/€147)
5. **AI Image Generation** - FLUX API integration exists
6. **Sandra AI Designer** - Claude 4.0 Sonnet integration

### ❌ CONFUSION POINTS IDENTIFIED

#### 1. MULTIPLE PRICING TIERS (PROBLEM)
- Currently has 3 tiers: €47 AI Pack, €97 Studio, €147 Studio Pro
- Creates confusion and decision paralysis
- **SOLUTION**: Simplify to ONE product: €97 SSELFIE STUDIO

#### 2. ONBOARDING FLOW BROKEN (MAJOR PROBLEM)
- Steps 1-5 are the same page with no real data collection
- Doesn't capture personalization data properly
- Brand questionnaire data not being saved to database
- **SOLUTION**: Rebuild with proper data collection

#### 3. WORKSPACE/STUDIO COMPLEXITY (PROBLEM)
- Too many tabs and features that don't work
- Confusing theme selection system
- No clear path from onboarding to actual tools
- **SOLUTION**: Simplify to core features: AI Generation + Landing Builder

#### 4. SANDRA AI FRAGMENTATION (PROBLEM)
- Multiple AI chat interfaces across different pages
- No unified AI agent that knows user's business
- **SOLUTION**: Single Sandra AI that learns and remembers user data

## SIMPLIFIED VISION IMPLEMENTATION PLAN
